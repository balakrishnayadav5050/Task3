SQL for Data Analysis (Using MySQL sys Schema)

## 🎯 Objective
Perform SQL-based performance analysis using the built-in `sys` schema in MySQL.

## 📦 Dataset
- MySQL internal: `sys` schema
- Used for performance insights (no external CSV/database required)

## 📋 What I Did

### 1. SELECT, WHERE, ORDER
- Queried top statements by execution count

### 2. JOIN
- Merged user-level statement data with host summary

### 3. Subquery
- Found hosts with above-average total connections

### 4. Aggregate
- Calculated average latency per user

### 5. View
- Created a view of high-latency queries

### 6. Optimization
- Not applicable (read-only schema), but analyzed slow queries
